# Measurement Unit
Soft and hardware to measure the refractive index increment using an Arduino board in combination with a PC running a Python program. With this software and an Arduino Uno or Arduino M0 you will be able to perform batch measurments to estimate the Refractive Index Increment(dn/dc) of a substance.  
Refractive Index Increment(dn/dc) is the rate of change of Refractive Index versus the concentration of the analyte in solution at a given temperature and a given light wavelength.
